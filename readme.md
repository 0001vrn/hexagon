Hexagon is a microservices framework that doesn't follow the flock. It is written in [Kotlin] and
its pursose is to ease the building of services (Web applications, APIs or Queue consumers). To 
achieve this goal, it takes care of:

* HTTP routing and HTML templates.
* Serialization and storage of data.
* Asynchronous communication through events.
* Task scheduling using Cron expressions.

The purpose of the project is to provide a microservices framework with the following priorities
(in order):

* Implement small services via RPC (HTTP) or Async (message based) (MQ)
* Change engines easily

1. Simple to use: make it easy to develop user services fast.
2. Easy to hack: allow the user to add extensions or change the framework.
3. Be small: this is really a requirement for the previous points.

Goals

* To prototype services quickly
* 

## Quick Start

1. Setup Kotlin in [Gradle][Setup Gradle] or [Maven][Setup Maven].
2. Setup the [JCenter repository](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter) (click on the `Set me up!`
   button).
3. Add the dependency:

  * In [Gradle]. Import it inside `build.gradle`:

    ```groovy
    compile ("com.hexagonkt:server_jetty:0.21.0")
    ```

  * In [Maven]. Declare the dependency in `pom.xml`:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.hexagonkt</groupId>
      <artifactId>server_jetty</artifactId>
      <version>0.21.0</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

4. Write the code in the `src/main/kotlin/Hello.kt` file:

    ```kotlin
    import com.hexagonkt.server.*
    import com.hexagonkt.server.jetty.*

    fun main(vararg args: String) {
        serve(JettyServletEngine()) {
            get("/hello/{name}") { "Hello ${request["name"]}!" }
        }
    }
    ```

5. Run the service and view the results at: [http://localhost:2010/hello/world][Endpoint]

You can read more details at the [Services] guide.

[Setup Gradle]: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html
[Setup Maven]: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-maven.html
[Endpoint]: http://localhost:2010/hello/world
[Maven]: https://maven.apache.org
[Gradle]: https://gradle.org

## Guides

* HTTP routing and HTML templates.
* Serialization and storage of data.
* Asynchronous communication through events.
* Task scheduling using Cron expressions.

* [Services]: explains how to create, build, test, package and run your services.
* [HTTP]: describes how to use Web routing and filters for HTTP services.
* [Serialization]: details how to serialize/deserialize object instances using different formats.
* [Storage]: gives an overview of how to store data using different data stores.

* [Events]: support asynchronous communication with events through message brokers.
* [Configuration]: allow the configuration of the engine by using YAML files.
* [Scheduling]: supports the execution of tasks periodically using Cron expressions.
* [Templates]: allow the service to render results using [Pebble] or [kotlinx.html].
* [Testing]: Hexagon adds utilities to ease the testing of its services.

## Status

**DISCLAIMER**: The project status is beta. Use it at your own risk. There are some modules not
started yet (ie: metrics and remote configuration) and the API is subject to change any time prior
 to release 1.0.

Performance is not the primary goal, but it is taken seriously. You can check performance numbers
in the [TechEmpower Web Framework Benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks)

Test, of course, are taken into account. This is the coverage grid:
