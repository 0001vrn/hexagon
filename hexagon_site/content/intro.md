# What is Hexagon

It is a µS fw focused on creating µS sync/async

It is meant to provide abstraction from underlying technoligies to be able to change them with
minimum impact.

Only Kotlin support

# Why it was created

* More time reading framework docs than coding
* Frameworks targeted to everyone instead my custom needs
* Easy to hack better than work ok for every use case
* For fun!
* To learn Kotlin

# How it works

modules (components and engines)

components (events, core, templates)

Needed infrastructure for µS

engines (feature implementations)

The heavy lifting is done by these ones (Undertow, Jetty, RabbitMQ, MongoDB)
